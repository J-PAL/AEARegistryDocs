### ABOUT THE REGISTRY

**Welcome!**

This is the American Economic Association's registry for randomized controlled trials.

Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are widely used in various fields of economics and other social sciences. As they become more numerous, a central registry on which trials are on-going or complete (or withdrawn) becomes important for various reasons: as a source of results for meta-analysis; as a one-stop resource to find out about available survey instruments and data.

Because existing registries are not well suited to the need for social sciences, in April 2012, the AEA executive committee decided to establish such a registry for economics and other social sciences.

**If you are running or have run a trial:** Registration is free and you do not need to be a member of the AEA to register. We encourage you to register any new study at its outset. However, given the backlog of existing trials, we invite you to also register past studies. If your trial is registered before the start of its intervention, we also encourage you to consider preparing a submission for [pre-results review](http://jde-preresultsreview.org/) at the Journal of Development Economics before beginning data collection.

**If you are searching for results:** Please browse the data base. More results are forthcoming!
