## TRIAL DATA ACCESS

### Downloading the Registry Data
The registry database is currently available for download through an accessible CSV (comma-separated values) file that compiles all current public information from each registered trial. We provide two options for downloading the data:

1. Downloading the monthly snapshots of the database from the AEA RCT Registry Dataverse.

2. Downloading a current snapshot of the database directly from the website. Directions for each downloading process are provided below.

### Downloading from the AEA RCT Registry Dataverse

The [AEA RCT Registry Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/aearegistry) contains monthly, historical snapshots of the registry database. The Dataverse issues a citation and a DOI for each monthly version of the database. Data is uploaded at the beginning of every month. Researchers can cite a particular monthly dataset when doing analysis or making tables and graphs.

Visit the [AEA RCT Registry Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/aearegistry) to access the data.

### Downloading from the AEA RCT Registry Website
Another way to access the registry data is by clicking the “Download as CSV” icon on [the Advanced Search page](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/search). The website download will provide the current version of the data; however, the data changes as researchers update their trials. We recommend using the data posted on the Dataverse if you are looking to add a citation and make your analysis reproducible.

The CSV file is updated approximately every ten minutes with new trials and modifications. As a result, if a trial was registered near the time of your download it may not be included in the CSV.

Below are instructions on how to download the data:

- Step One: From the main homepage of the registry, please click “Advanced Search” next to the search bar. This will make all trials searchable.
